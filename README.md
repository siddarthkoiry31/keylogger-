# Project Name: Keylogger

## Project Description
The project involves the development of a basic keylogger, a type of software that captures keystrokes. The keylogger records all the keys pressed on the keyboard and saves this data into a file named "keylogger.txt".

The program is designed to automatically send the contents of this file, which includes the recorded keystrokes, to a specified email address. This feature can be potentially expanded in the future to allow the keylogger to send the keystrokes at regular intervals.

## Applications
While this keylogger can be used for legitimate purposes such as keeping logs of keyboard activity, it's important to note that it can also be misused for malicious purposes. Therefore, it's crucial to use such software responsibly and ethically.

## Future Scope
The project could be extended to include a feature that sends updates at regular intervals, providing real-time monitoring of keystrokes. However, this enhancement is planned for a future iteration of the project.
